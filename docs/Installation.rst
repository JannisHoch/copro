Installation
=========================

To install copro from GitHub, first clone the code. It is advised to create an individual python environment first. 

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/JannisHoch/copro.git
    $ cd path/to/copro
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml

It is now possible to activate this environment with

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda activate copro

To install CoPro in editable mode in this environment, run this command next

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -e <path/to/copro>/copro
