Installation
=========================

To install copro from GitHub, first clone the code. It is advised to create an individual python environment first. 

.. note::

    It is advised to use Anaconda or Miniconda to install CoPro as this was used to develop and test the model.
    For installation instructions, see `here <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/JannisHoch/copro.git
    $ cd path/to/copro
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml

It is now possible to activate this environment with

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda activate copro

To install CoPro in editable mode in this environment, run this command next in the CoPro-folder:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -e .
