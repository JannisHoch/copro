=========================

This is the documentation website of the 'conflict_model', a (machine learning) model for mapping environmental drivers of conflict risk.

Main goal
---------------
The main goal of this model is to apply machine learning techniques to make projections of future areas at risk. While the model was developed with a rather clear
objective in mind, we put a lot of emphasis on making it flexible. We hope that other, related questions about climate and conflict can be tackled as well, and that our process
understanding is deepend further.
