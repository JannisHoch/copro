Workflow
=========

This page provides a short example workflow in Jupyter Notebooks. 
It is designed such that the main steps, features, assumptions, and outcomes of CoPro become clear.

As model input data, the data set downloadable from `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/record/4297295>`_ was used. 

Even though the model can be perfectly executed using notebooks, the main (and more convenient) way of model execution is the command line script (see :ref:`script`).
