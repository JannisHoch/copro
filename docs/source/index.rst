CoPro
=========================

This is the documentation of CoPro, a machine-learning tool for conflict risk projections.

A software description paper was published in `JOSS <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02855>`_.

Main goal
---------------
With CoPro it is possible to apply machine-learning techniques to make projections of future areas at risk. CoPro was developed with a rather clear
application in mind, unravelling the interplay of socio-economic development, climate change, and conflict occurrence. 
Nevertheless, we put a lot of emphasis on making it flexible. 
We hope that other, related questions about climate and conflict can be tackled as well, and that process understanding is deepened further.
