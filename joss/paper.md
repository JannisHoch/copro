# Summary

Climate change is considered an important driver of conflict risk, in conjuction with contextual informatoin such as the governance quality and gross domestic product of a country.
In light of locally worsening conditions, there is a real risk of increased armed conflict encounters. To efficiently plan and implement adaptatation and mitigation measures, it is key to first obtain an understanding the influence of climate, environmental, and societal drivers on conflict riks. And second, conflict risk needs to be projected to a given point to be able to prepare accordingly. With CoPro, a set of functions and workflow is made openly-accessible to perform these steps. It caters for a variety of settings and input data, thereby capturing the multitude of facets of the climate-environment-conflict nexus.

# Statement of need 

There is increasing consensus that climate change can exacerbate the risk of (armed) conflict [@hegre2013predicting].
