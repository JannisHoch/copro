    "## Reading the files and storing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an essential part of CoPro. For a machine-learning model to work, it requires a samples matrix (X), representing here the socio-economic and hydro-climatic 'drivers' of conflict, and target values (Y) representing the (observed) conflicts themselves. By fitting a machine-learning model, a relation between X and Y is established, which in turn can be used to make projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information can be found on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html#fitting-and-predicting-estimator-basics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since CoPro simulates conflict risk spatially explicit for each polygons (here water provinces), it is furthermore needed to be able to associate each polygon with the corresponding data points in X and Y. We therefore also keep a polygon-ID and its geometry, and track it throughout the modelling chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "CoPro goes through all model years as specified in the cfg-file. Per year, CoPro loops over all polygons remaining after the selection procedure (see previous notebook) and does the following to obtain the **X-data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Assign ID to polygon and retrieve geometry information;*\n",
    "2. *Calculate a statistical value per polygon from each input file specified in the cfg-file in section 'data'. Which statistical value is ought to be computed needs to be specified in the cfg-file. In the cfg-file, it's furthermore possible to specify whether values are ought to be log-transformed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that CoPro applies a 1 year time-lag by default. That means that for a given year *J*, the data from year *J-1* is read. This is to avoid issues with backwards reversibility, i.e. we assume that the driver results in conflict (or not) with one year delay and not immediately in the same year.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to obtain the **Y-data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Assign a Boolean value whether a conflict took place in a polygon or not - the number of casualties or conflicts per year is not relevant in thise case.*\n",
    "\n",
    "All information is stored in a X-array and a Y-array. The X-array has *2+n* columns whereby *n* denotes the number of samples provided. The Y-array has obviously only 1 column, consisting of zeros and ones.\n",
    "In both arrays is the number of rows determined as number of years times the number of polygons. In case a row contains a missing value (e.g. because one input data does not cover this polygon), the entire row is removed from the XY-array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the sample values can still range a lot depending on their units, measurement, etc. In the next notebook, the X-data will be scaled to be able to compare the different values in the samples matrix."
