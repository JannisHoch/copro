    "\n",
    "This is an essential part of the code. For a machine-learning model to work, it requires a samples matrix (X), representing the 'drivers' of conflict, and target values (Y) representing the conflicts themselves. By fitting a machine-learning model, a relation between X and Y is established, which in turn can be used to make projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information can be found on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html#fitting-and-predicting-estimator-basics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since CoPro simulates conflict risk not only globally, but also spatially explicit for provided polygons, it is furthermore needed to be able to associate each polygons with the corresponding data points in X and Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "CoPro goes through all model years as specified in the cfg-file. Per year, CoPro loops over all polygons remaining after the selection procedure (see previous notebook) and does the following to obtain the X-data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assing ID to polygon and retrieve geometry information;\n",
    "2. Calculate the mean value per polygon from each input file specified in the cfg-file in section 'data'.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to obtain the Y-data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign a Boolean value whether a conflict took place in a polygon or not - the number of casualties or conflicts per year is not relevant in thise case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information is stored in a X-array and a Y-array. The X-array has 2+n columns whereby n denotes the number of samples provided. The Y-array has obviously only 1 column.\n",
    "In both arrays is the number of rows determined as number of years times the number of polygons. In case a row contains a missing value, the entire row is removed from the XY-array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the sample values can still range a lot depending on their units, measurement, etc. In the next notebook, the X-data will be scaled to be able to compare the different values in the samples matrix."
